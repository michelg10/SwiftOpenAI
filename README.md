## Getting an API Key

⚠️ **Important**

To interact with OpenAI services, you'll need an API key. Follow these steps to obtain one:

1. Visit [OpenAI](https://www.openai.com/).
2. Sign up for an [account](https://platform.openai.com/signup) or [log in](https://platform.openai.com/login) if you already have one.
3. Navigate to the [API key page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and follow the instructions to generate a new API key.

For more information, consult OpenAI's [official documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/).

⚠️  Please take precautions to keep your API key secure per [OpenAI's guidance](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication):

> Remember that your API key is a secret! Do not share it with others or expose
> it in any client-side code (browsers, apps). Production requests must be
> routed through your backend server where your API key can be securely
> loaded from an environment variable or key management service.

SwiftOpenAI has built-in support for AIProxy, which is a backend for AI apps, to satisfy this requirement.
To configure AIProxy, see the instructions [here](#aiproxy).


## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

1. Open your Swift project in Xcode.
2. Go to `File` ->  `Add Package Dependency`.
3. In the search bar, enter [this URL](https://github.com/jamesrochabrun/SwiftOpenAI).
4. Choose the version you'd like to install.
5. Click `Add Package`.

## Usage

To use SwiftOpenAI in your project, first import the package:

```swift
import SwiftOpenAI
```

Then, initialize the service using your OpenAI API key:

```swift
let apiKey = "your_openai_api_key_here"
let service = OpenAIServiceFactory.service(apiKey: apiKey)
```

You can optionally specify an organization name if needed.

```swift
let apiKey = "your_openai_api_key_here"
let oganizationID = "your_organixation_id"
let service = OpenAIServiceFactory.service(apiKey: apiKey, organizationID: oganizationID)
```

That's all you need to begin accessing the full range of OpenAI endpoints.

### Audio

### Audio Transcriptions
Parameters
```swift
public struct AudioTranscriptionParameters: Encodable {

   let file: Data
   /// ID of the model to use. Only whisper-1 is currently available.
   let model: String
   /// The language of the input audio. Supplying the input language in [ISO-639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) format will improve accuracy and latency.

### Chat
Parameters
```swift
/// [Create chat completion](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create)
public struct ChatCompletionParameters: Encodable {
   
   /// A list of messages comprising the conversation so far. [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_format_inputs_to_chatgpt_models)
   public var messages: [Message]
   /// ID of the model to use. See the [model endpoint compatibility](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/how-we-use-your-data) table for details on which models work with the Chat API.
   let model: String
   /// Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim. Defaults to 0
   /// [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/parameter-details)
   public var frequencyPenalty: Double?
   /// Controls how the model responds to function calls. none means the model does not call a function, and responds to the end-user. auto means the model can pick between an end-user or calling a function. Specifying a particular function via {"name": "my_function"} forces the model to call that function. none is the default when no functions are present. auto is the default if functions are present.
   @available(*, deprecated, message: "Deprecated in favor of tool_choice.")
   public var functionCall: FunctionCall?
   /// Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. none means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message. 
   /// auto means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a particular function via `{"type: "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that function.
   /// `none` is the default when no functions are present. auto is the default if functions are present.
   public var toolChoice: ToolChoice?
   /// A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.
   @available(*, deprecated, message: "Deprecated in favor of tools.")
   public var functions: [ChatFunction]?
   /// A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.
   public var tools: [Tool]?
   /// Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.
   /// Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token. Defaults to null.
   public var logitBias: [Int: Double]?
   /// Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the content of message. This option is currently not available on the gpt-4-vision-preview model. Defaults to false.
   public var logprobs: Bool?
   /// An integer between 0 and 5 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. logprobs must be set to true if this parameter is used.
   public var topLogprobs: Int?
   /// The maximum number of [tokens](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) to generate in the chat completion.
   /// The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length. Example [Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken) for counting tokens.
   public var maxTokens: Int?
   /// How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Defaults to 1.
   public var n: Int?
   /// Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. Defaults to 0
   /// [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/parameter-details)
   public var presencePenalty: Double?
   /// An object specifying the format that the model must output. Used to enable JSON mode.
   /// Setting to `{ type: "json_object" }` enables `JSON` mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.
   ///Important: when using `JSON` mode you must still instruct the model to produce `JSON` yourself via some conversation message, for example via your system message. If you don't do this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, which may take a lot of time and give the appearance of a "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partial (i.e. cut off) if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.
   public var responseFormat: ResponseFormat?
   /// This feature is in `Beta`. If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result.
   /// Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.
   public var seed: Int?
   /// Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. Defaults to null.
   public var stop: [String]?
   /// If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#event_stream_format) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a data: [DONE] message. [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_stream_completions ).
   /// Defaults to false.
   var stream: Bool? = nil
   /// What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.
   /// We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both. Defaults to 1.
   public var temperature: Double?
   /// An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.
   /// We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both. Defaults to 1
   public var topP: Double?
   /// A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse.

}
```
Usage
```swift
let prompt = "Tell me a joke"
let parameters = ChatCompletionParameters(messages: [.init(role: .user, content: .text(prompt))], model: .gpt41106Preview)
let chatCompletionObject = try await service.startStreamedChat(parameters: parameters)
```

### Function Calling

Chat Completion also supports [Function Calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) and [Parallel Function Calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling/parallel-function-calling). `functions` has been deprecated in favor of `tools` check [OpenAI Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create) for more.

```swift
public struct ToolCall: Codable {

   public let index: Int
   /// The ID of the tool call.
   public let id: String?
   /// The type of the tool. Currently, only `function` is supported.
   public let type: String?
   /// The function that the model called.
   public let function: FunctionCall

   public init(
      index: Int,
      id: String,
      type: String = "function",
      function: FunctionCall)
   {
      self.index = index
      self.id = id
      self.type = type
      self.function = function
   }
}

public struct FunctionCall: Codable {

   /// The arguments to call the function with, as generated by the model in JSON format. Note that the model does not always generate valid JSON, and may hallucinate parameters not defined by your function schema. Validate the arguments in your code before calling your function.
   let arguments: String
   /// The name of the function to call.
   let name: String

   public init(
      arguments: String,
      name: String)
   {
      self.arguments = arguments
      self.name = name
   }
}
```

Usage
```swift
/// Define a `ToolCall`
var tool: ToolCall {
   .init(
      type: "function", // The type of the tool. Currently, only "function" is supported.
      function: .init(
         name: "create_image",
         description: "Call this function if the request asks to generate an image",
         parameters: .init(
            type: .object,
            properties: [
               "prompt": .init(type: .string, description: "The exact prompt passed in."),
               "count": .init(type: .integer, description: "The number of images requested")
            ],
            required: ["prompt", "count"])))
}

let prompt = "Show me an image of an unicorn eating ice cream"
let content: ChatCompletionParameters.Message.ContentType = .text(prompt)
let parameters = ChatCompletionParameters(messages: [.init(role: .user, content: content)], model: .gpt41106Preview, tools: [tool])
let chatCompletionObject = try await service.startStreamedChat(parameters: parameters)
```

### Vision

[Vision](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision) API is available for use; developers must access it through the chat completions API, specifically using the gpt-4-vision-preview model. Using any other model will not provide an image description

Usage
```swift
let imageURL = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg"
let prompt = "What is this?"
let messageContent: [ChatCompletionParameters.Message.ContentType.MessageContent] = [.text(prompt), .imageUrl(imageURL)] // Users can add as many `.imageUrl` instances to the service.
let parameters = ChatCompletionParameters(messages: [.init(role: .user, content: .contentArray(messageContent))], model: .gpt4VisionPreview)
let chatCompletionObject = try await service.startStreamedChat(parameters: parameters)
```

### Images

For handling image sizes, we utilize the `Dalle` model. An enum with associated values has been defined to represent its size constraints accurately.

 [DALL·E](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/dall-e)
 
 DALL·E is a AI system that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language. DALL·E 3 currently supports the ability, given a prompt, to create a new image with a specific size. DALL·E 2 also support the ability to edit an existing image, or create variations of a user provided image.
 
 DALL·E 3 is available through our Images API along with DALL·E 2. You can try DALL·E 3 through ChatGPT Plus.

⚠️ To utilize the `createRunAndStreamMessage`, first create an assistant and initiate a thread.

Usage
[Create Run](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/runs/createRun) with stream.

The `createRunAndStreamMessage` streams [events](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants-streaming/events), You can decide which one you need for your implementation. For example, this is how you can access message delta and run step delta objects

```swift
let assistantID = "asst_abc123""
let threadID = "thread_abc123"
let messageParameter = MessageParameter(role: .user, content: "Tell me the square root of 1235")
let message = try await service.createMessage(threadID: threadID, parameters: messageParameter)
let runParameters = RunParameter(assistantID: assistantID)
let stream = try await service.createRunAndStreamMessage(threadID: threadID, parameters: runParameters)

         for try await result in stream {
            switch result {
            case .threadMessageDelta(let messageDelta):
               let content = messageDelta.delta.content.first
               switch content {
               case .imageFile, nil:
                  break
               case .text(let textContent):
                  print(textContent.text.value) // this will print the streamed response for a message.
               }
               
            case .threadRunStepDelta(let runStepDelta):
               if let toolCall = runStepDelta.delta.stepDetails.toolCalls?.first?.toolCall {
                  switch toolCall {
                  case .codeInterpreterToolCall(let toolCall):
                     print(toolCall.input ?? "") // this will print the streamed response for code interpreter tool call.
                  case .retrieveToolCall(let toolCall):
                     print("Retrieve tool call")
                  case .functionToolCall(let toolCall):
                     print("Function tool call")
                  case nil:
                     break
                  }
               }
            }
         }
```

You can go to the [Examples folder](https://github.com/jamesrochabrun/SwiftOpenAI/tree/main/Examples/SwiftOpenAIExample/SwiftOpenAIExample) in this package, navigate to the 'Configure Assistants' tab, create an assistant, and follow the subsequent steps.

## Azure OpenAI

This library provides support for both chat completions and chat stream completions through Azure OpenAI. Currently, `DefaultOpenAIAzureService` supports chat completions, including both streamed and non-streamed options.

For more information about Azure configuration refer to the [documentation.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference)

To instantiate `DefaultOpenAIAzureService` you need to provide a `AzureOpenAIConfiguration`

```swift
let azureConfiguration = AzureOpenAIConfiguration(
                           resourceName: "YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME", 
                           openAIAPIKey: .apiKey("YOUR_OPENAI_APIKEY), 
                           apiVersion: "THE_API_VERSION")
                           
let service = OpenAIServiceFactory.service(azureConfiguration: azureConfiguration)           
```

supported api version can be found on the azure [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference#completions)

Current Supported versions

```2022-12-01```
```2023-03-15-preview```
```2023-05-15```
```2023-06-01-preview```
```2023-07-01-preview```

### Usage on [Chat completions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference#chat-completions):

```swift
let parameters = ChatCompletionParameters(
                     messages: [.init(role: .user, content: .text(prompt))], 
                     model: .custom("DEPLOYMENT_NAME") /// The deployment name you chose when you deployed the model. e.g: "gpt-35-turbo-0613"
let completionObject = try await service.startChat(parameters: parameters)
```

## AIProxy

### What is it?

[AIProxy](https://www.aiproxy.pro) is a backend for AI apps that proxies requests from your app to OpenAI.
You can use this service to avoid exposing your OpenAI key in your app.
We offer AIProxy support so that developers can build **and** distribute apps using SwiftOpenAI.  

### How does my SwiftOpenAI code change?

SwiftOpenAI supports proxying requests through AIProxy with a small change to your integration code.

Instead of initializing `service` with:

        let apiKey = "your_openai_api_key_here"
        let service = OpenAIServiceFactory.service(apiKey: apiKey)

Use:

        #if DEBUG && targetEnvironment(simulator)
        let service = OpenAIServiceFactory.service(
            aiproxyPartialKey: "hardcode_partial_key_here",
            aiproxyDeviceCheckBypass: "hardcode_device_check_bypass_here"
        )
        #else
        let service = OpenAIServiceFactory.service(
            aiproxyPartialKey: "hardcode_partial_key_here"
        )
        #endif

The `aiproxyPartialKey` and `aiproxyDeviceCheckBypass` values are provided to you on the [AIProxy developer dashboard](https://developer.aiproxy.pro).

⚠️  It is important that you do not let the `aiproxyDeviceCheckBypass` token leak into a distribution
build of your app (including TestFlight distributions). Please retain the conditional compilation
checks that are present in the sample code above.

#### What is the `aiproxyDeviceCheckBypass` constant?

AIProxy uses Apple's [DeviceCheck](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck) to ensure
that requests received by the backend originated from your app on a legitimate Apple device.
However, the iOS simulator cannot produce DeviceCheck tokens. Rather than requiring you to
constantly build and run on device during development, AIProxy provides a way to skip the
DeviceCheck integrity check. The token is intended for use by developers only. If an attacker gets
the token, they can make requests to your AIProxy project without including a DeviceCheck token, and
thus remove one level of protection.

#### What is the `aiproxyPartialKey` constant?

This constant is intended to be **included** in the distributed version of your app. As the name implies, it is a
partial representation of your OpenAI key. Specifically, it is one half of an encrypted version of your key.
The other half resides on AIProxy's backend. As your app makes requests to AIProxy, the two encrypted parts
are paired, decrypted, and used to fulfill the request to OpenAI.

#### How to setup my project on AIProxy?
